Implementing a neural network for digit classificationwith tensorflow as an introduction to deep learning. Comments to understand better the process behind the code 
I did this small project as a way to approach and try to understand better neural networks not only as code but the process behind it. The comments on the code explain in a simple but effective way what this kind of machine learning is about and what are its goals.
